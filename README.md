# FaceDetectionHaarCascade
In this program we are using our open cv library and pretrained Haar-Like classifier to detect the face of a person

**What is Haar Like Features**
Haar-like features are digital image features used in object recognition. They owe their name to their intuitive similarity with Haar wavelets and were used in the first real-time face detector.

**What is a Cascade Classifier**
Cascading is a particular case of ensemble learning based on the concatenation of several classifiers, using all information collected from the output from a given classifier as additional information for the next classifier in the cascade. Unlike voting or stacking ensembles, which are multiexpert systems, cascading is a multistage one.

Cascading classifiers are trained with several hundred "positive" sample views of a particular object and arbitrary "negative" images of the same size. After the classifier is trained it can be applied to a region of an image and detect the object in question. To search for the object in the entire frame, the search window can be moved across the image and check every location for the classifier. This process is most commonly used in image processing for object detection and tracking, primarily facial detection and recognition.
